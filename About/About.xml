	<description>Mod that makes it so that when you have a group of pawns selected where multiple have the same utility equipped, it only uses one of them instead of using them all. 
	Currently, only works with Low Shield Packs, Toxic Packs, and Firefoam Pop Packs. (Lances seem to already only use one at a time.) The decision of which pawn's utility gets used seems to be random.</description>
